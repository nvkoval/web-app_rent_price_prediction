## Project Description

This project provides a machine learning-powered web application to predict rental prices for apartments in Kyiv. The app uses a LightGBM regression model with conformal prediction intervals (via MAPIE) and a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

### Features

- Predicts apartment rental prices based on:
  - Location (district, address)
  - Apartment size (full, living, kitchen area)
  - Number of rooms, floor, and building details
  - Amenities and repair state
- Provides prediction intervals for price estimates
- Explains model predictions with feature importance

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
    - Scraped rental listings from site
    - Cleaned and preprocessed data
2. **Feature Engineering**
    - Created additional features (e.g., geocoding, area ratios)
    - See [noteboks/real_estate_feature_eng.ipynb](noteboks/real_estate_feature_eng.ipynb)
3. **Model Training**
    - Trained LightGBM model with pipeline ([src/model.py](src/model.py))
    - Saved models to [data/](data/)
4. **Prediction & Explanation**
    - Streamlit app ([app.py](app.py)) loads models and provides predictions with explanations

### Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, MAPIE
- Streamlit (web app)
- Geopy (geocoding)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
